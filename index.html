        <p>Wrote a little java program that generates html code for the articles on the web page. For now it's just using the default console interface, but planning to add some kind of graphical editor, as the console isn't very convienent. Java interfaces are a bit cumbersome, so I've been avoiding them for a while, but I guess I'll have no choice this time if I want to do anything else with this program.</p>
        <p>The website has been updated with a new color scheme, borders are now much more in line with 960px web standard and should scale well on mobile. I have decided to learn javascript, not just for the development of the website, but to use in Unity for future game development, as I became pretty fond of Unity after working on a student project.</p>
        <p>Aaaand, that's it for now. Going to keep updating this website as a personal dev blog and a self-motivation tool.</p>

        <p>This website was created as an online portfolio to show off projects that I have worked on or currently are working for. The website was also a crash course for learning HTML and CSS. I wanted the site to consist of manually coded HTML and CSS, no dreamweaver or drawscript, although I ended up using bits of javascript for custom fonts and shorter borders. I also wanted the website to just be purely functional, no unnesecary effects, image banners or anything like that. After all, it serves as a static portfolio, not as a dynamic, heavy on user content website.  </p>
        <p>The website will probably evolve greatly in the future, but it is as it is right now. I am planning to work on several game projects in the very soon future, so the progress on those and their final incarnations will be uploaded on this website.</p>
