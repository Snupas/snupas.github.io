        <p>This website was created as an online portfolio to show off projects that I have worked on or currently are working for. The website was also a crash course for learning HTML and CSS. I wanted the site to consist of manually coded HTML and CSS, no dreamweaver or drawscript, although I ended up using bits of javascript for custom fonts and shorter borders. I also wanted the website to just be purely functional, no unnesecary effects, image banners or anything like that. After all, it serves as a static portfolio, not as a dynamic, heavy on user content website.  </p>
        <p>The website will probably evolve greatly in the future, but it is as it is right now. I am planning to work on several game projects in the very soon future, so the progress on those and their final incarnations will be uploaded on this website.</p>
